Looks like most of yall have found "the" place. We're preparing for the time collapse, and if everything goes well. We should end up in a different timeline, in a different universe. My team have been calculating the outcome of the explosion, we're looking at a full reality collapse. You wont be seeing home for much longer, so say your goodbyes because "Home", will cease to exist. Goodluck soldier's, I'll see you on the other side...
