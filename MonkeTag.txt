Woah, that worked... I didn't think we would be back here, it feels surreal. You probably don't know what I'm talking 
about, and I don't blame you. Traveling to an entirely different reality would scramble your brain around.
All you need to know is you are safe now, and Sir T. cannot return. Enjoy the Christmas vibes, I've heard
the penguins come out around this time of year...
