OoOoo It's chilly out there, If I were you, I would head down to the shop to get some
winter gear to prep for them harsh winds. Maybe then, you could head on down to mountains, I heard its nice 
this time of year! Us Monkes, have been decorating for Christmas. Can't you believe I'ts almost here.
Well enough of me, go out there and explore!
